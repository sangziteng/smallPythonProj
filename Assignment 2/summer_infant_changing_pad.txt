Nothing fancy but works like a charm. Comfy and durable, and a great price. Works well with standard carters covers.

The edged on my pad are slightly dented.  Once I put the cover on, it covers the cosmetic flaw.  The dented foam could be from the packaging in the mail or the storage from the store.  I could have returned the product, but realized that it wouldn't change the function.  The rubber on the bottom does not stop the pad from sliding.  I have anchored the pad using the screw provided to the dress that I am using as the changing pad.  The pad still slides around slightly (because of how I anchored the pad), but I know the baby will never be on the changing pad without my supervision.

I personally thought we would use this a lot more but as it turns out we hardly ever use it. We never bought a changing table so there was really no point in having this. Oh well maybe we'll keep it for the next one? Overall though I think it is a great product and of good quality we just never really used it.

No grip on the bottom. Slides everywhere. Dangerous!!! I have one that has a rubber backing that is a lot safer. Buy in the store so you can see.

This was a std changing pad, looked ok, did its job, but while transporting it in a suitcase from one destination to another it crushed very badly. Nothing that a cover couldn't hide though! Its good for its price, buy it!

this is  a perfect changing pad. great for baby, love the contour helps keep baby from rolling around. Also like that you can use different textured covers from flannel to cotton. this is the one you want, nothing wrong with it. Sturdy but soft, good material, good price :)

No complaints - works well.  Not sure how much more there is to say about a changing pad, but it fit our changing table, seems to provide enough support, and was delightfully easy to wipe up when we had our first mid-change tinkle.

We used this for at least the first 4-6 months of our daughters life. We never did use the strap because we just held her with our hands (proper placement and planning). The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is because it constantly wanted to slide off of the dressor/table. There was no &#34;grip&#34; on the bottom to keep it in place and we were constantly adjusting it. However, with the pad covers we bought (2 was enough) we were able to use it through tons of ....poop.

I ordered this to fit on a Just One You by Carter's brand changing table and it fit perfectly.  Babies R' Us brand changing covers also fit on here which was a plus!  Nice and soft for baby to lie down on and is waterproof which is excellent.  Best of all, this was much less expensive then many of the other ones out there and is great!

At 11 months with a now walking baby we haven't had on incident with her falling from this pad. I wouldn't recommend a cover for this we bought two and every time we put one on she would just pee on it. we have less accidents without the cover on for whatever reason. It does clean up nicely but does stain. We thoroughly cleaned after accidents but over time they do accumulate. we ended up buying a second pad  at 9 months and the difference in color was shocking.

I bought this changing pad for a changing table that I had purchased and it fit perfectly (standard size).  I have two of these, one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  The other one sits upon a dresser that it is tethered too and that one works great as well. The shape is perfect so that your child cannot easily roll off and the strap is nice and sturdy if you have an extra squirmy baby.  One extra bonus is that it is made of material that can be wiped easily in the event you do not want to use a changing pad cover.

We bought this at our local baby store and came home to find out it was almost $15 cheaper through Amazon . . . and it qualified for free shipping.  That was a no brainer!  It shipped quickly and though the box was almost torn open, the product was in perfect shape.We use this pad at least half a dozen times everyday.  Our babies first smiles came every time we laid him on here for a change.  At about 3 months he went through a phase of hating it (I think because he wanted to try and figure out rolling over), and now that he is rolling this pad helps us turn him back quickly for an easy change (if we use the floor it is harder to turn him back, somehow the curves are what help).  I know it isn't a necessity . . . but we are super grateful we bought it.  Well worth the money.

I have looked at stores near us for a changing pad and found they range from $25-$45. And then, you have to buy a cover on top of that. The $15 price tag for this changing pad is great. It fits on top of baby's dresser perfectly. Highly recommended.

We had gotten this changing pad to use on a dresser, not a changing table, so when we received a changing table as a gift, I was worried that the pad wouldn't fit and I'd have to use the thin, uncomfortable-looking one that came with the table.Fortunately, I was wrong- this changing pad fits great on our changing table! I love the contour- it makes me feel much more secure about having to take my hands off my squirmy LO for a moment. That's even true now that my son is 5 months old and can sit up (and so, of course, now hates lying down). The first few times he wanted to sit up during diaper changes, I was terrified that he would fall. But the way the pad contours keeps his butt planted firmly in place!I like the material the pad is covered in because it's very easy to clean. Since I really wanted something that was, I didn't buy a cover for it- just one more thing to wash, right? That being said, I was a little worried that the material would be to harsh for my LO's skin (which is very sensitive). The first few weeks after he was born, I used a flannel-covered portable changing pad on top of this one (I use the one by Kushies and love it) to protect his skin. Well, the first time he pooped whole I was changing him put an end to that. But despite my concerns, he doesn't seem bothered by the material at all. So no cons that I can find- great product, great price!

We bought this changing pad for use with a newborn.  As other reviewers noted it is nice and thick, and is a good size that allowed us to continue using it as he grew older.  On the plus side, the raised edges provide a little extra comfort level for the parent, and also help keep anything unwanted from getting off of the pad (if you have a boy).  On the negative side, as another reviewer noted, the straps can scratch the surface underneath the pad.  Also, certain changing pad covers can cause the entire pad to slide when you are lifting a larger infant's legs during changing.  Other than these issues, which are hard to avoid in a changing pad, it works well and seems to be very comfortable for the infant.

I needed a new changing pad and almost bought one at the store for almost 3 times the price of this one.  I waited and decided I should check out amazon first.  I am very happy I waited and didn't buy the one at the store.  The price was great on this one and I am very pleased with the product.  It fits perfectly on my changing table and feels really soft and comfy for my daughter. This pad is a little bit larger than the previous one I had, but I haven't had a problem fitting any of the various brands of covers I have on it.

My only complaint is the little holes in the quilted stitching.  We use it without a cover to make cleanups easier.  The previous one we had had a smooth surface, no little tiny quilting-type holes.  Anyway, here comes the icky part - when your baby poops... sometimes some falls off the butt or wipe, right?  Well, then it goes onto the changing pad... into the holes... which are impossible to get all the way clean.  Personally, I think this is gross.  I wouldn't buy this again because of that one issue.

I am so glad I bought this changing pad.  It fits our Graco Sarah changing table perfectly.  (The pad that came with the table was too thin and flimsy!)  This pad is thick and sturdy, and the contour is perfect...baby fits just right--has wiggle room but with little walls on either side to help stay put! :)  I think the contour adds a safety feature because it makes it harder for baby to roll off (even though you would never leave him unattended, of course.  I don't use the strap to hold baby (who would mess with that?) but I did use it to hold the pad to the changing table, fastening it underneath the shelf and it worked perfectly!  I have a Carter's dots changing pad cover for this pad which also fits perfectly, fyi.  When bare, the pad easily wipes clean.  Go ahead and buy this, you'll like it!

I thought that this pad was really cheap thats why I got it, but I was really happy with the pad. It has a waterproof cover so that it cause be wiped down and cleaned easily. It has a strap the hold the baby on. Its contoured so the baby does not roll to much. I think it has everything I need in a changing pad. Also all my covers fit well on it.

this works for helping keep our son on the changing table, which is exactly what we bought it for. I woulf recommend getting a cover for it, or putting down  a recing blanket to help with cleaning. Since there is a pattern/texture worked into the waterproof cover, dirty blowout dipers can be extra hard to clean.

This changing pad served it's purpose well.  I recently took the changing table out of my 14 month old daughter's room but kept the changing pad to use on the floor when I change her diaper.  Sometimes she finds it and puts it on the floor herself to lay on.  It's thick and comfy.

This is the third changing pad I've used for my young daughter. For some reason, she likes being on the changing pad and it calms her down. This one is great because of the contoured sides. She had recently started trying to roll over from back to belly and I feel better knowing that these sides make it more difficult for her to do. I haven't used the safety belt yet, but surely will once she is successful in rolling over. The waterproof pad is easy to be cleaned up for anything that might leak through the changing pad cover (purchased separately).

Good size and firmness.  I bought two and have put it on normal dressers.  It saves a lot of money to not have to buy a changing table.  It gives you the option to secure it to a flat surface.  We haven't done that, even with a very active toddler, it stays in place.  We use it with the summer infant pad covers which are great too.

Date: 03 12, 2013
This pad is great. I love that the sides are curved up for a little added roll protection but the ends are open so my very long son will not outgrow it to quickly. I read some reviews that said the textured pattern is hard to clean but I have not found that to be the case. I always keep a cover or towel over it anyhow unless by chance they are all dirty at the moment.

I was so disappointed when I received this changing pad. It had good reviews and the price was fair. I have a feeling I received a bad one, but have no way of knowing that for sure.  The vinyl on mine was twisted/contorted and wouldn't lay flat down on the pad. I even tried to adjust it a bit, but nothing helped. Had to return this item.

I bought this based on all the positive reviews. It is a nice changing pad. My changing table pad covers fit it nicely (Carters Super Soft Star/Moon Changing Pad Cover, Blue. Unfortunately, I'm not that impressed with it. I have it secured to the back of my changing table/dresser. A waterproof pad to lay on this is a must. While this changing table pad is mostly waterproof, it isn't completely waterproof. There is a quilted pattern woven into it, if your baby pees or poops directly on the changing table pad the liquid goes through the tiny holes and absorbs into the changing pad. Once inside these crevices, the accident is impossible to remove. It is unsightly. I can only imagine how unsanitary it is and how much bacteria must be growing in it. Even if you wipe up accidents immediately, it still is too late.

I had to take away one star for this based on the packaging it came in. It really looked like someone just put the changing pad into the box and did a half-job on taping the box together. I'm actually quite surprised the changing pad itself wasn't damaged due to the crap tape job. Nevertheless, the changing pad is very nice, sturdy, thick and a bit bigger than I expected but worth the money.

This is a REALLY cool pad - just enough 'give' to keep your baby comfy while you're changing him/her.

We have only been using this pad for a few months now (bought in September 2010).  Usually we put a protective towel or blanket on top as well.  Seldom we use a disinfectant wipe to clean it off.  BUT, we have noticed that the vinyl has already started to break down and small tears/holes are forming.  Really inexplicable except for poor quality?  Otherwise, the contoured changing pad works well for us.  Not sure I would recommend since it's starting to get ratty looking already.

I like the size an cushion of this changing pad.  It is a standard size, so most covers will fit nicely on it.  I put this on top of our dresser, and skipped the separate changing table to save room in the nursery.  My only gripe about this model is that it only has one security strap, I have seen others that have two straps.  But this isn't that big of a deal, as the underside of the pad is a non-slip material so it helps to keep it in place.

This changing pad is exactly what I needed and expected. It is soft, has a safety belt, has a waterproof cover, and is large enough for my now 7 month old. I actually put a warm, cozy blanket on top of it, and wedge it between my bed and the wall on top of an ottoman so that my baby can still sleep in my room (since he outgrew his bassinet). It is basically his own little bed next to my bed. He has his nice crib in his nursery, but sleeps with me for part of the night on this changing pad as a bed pad.

This product had an awful chemical smell straight out of the package. I figured airing it out for a couple of hours would fix the problem but it did not get better. It also feels very cheaply made. It doesn't retain its shape and the material has a lot of folds and creases that show through even after you put a cover on. I'm going to have to return this product and go to a store and purchase one so we dont have the same problem.

This is exactly what I thought it would be.  It is a contoured pad for a changing table.  I have used it since my son was born without any problems.  I put a blanket under one end to raise the head up because my son had acid reflux for his first 8 months and that helped.  Maybe Summer Infant can make one that is slightly higher on one end.  This is a decent item, and I would recommend it.

I didn't want a changing table, but I bought this last minute before my baby was born, and I'm so glad I did.  I didn't get the table so we just put this on the ground, which is nice because we don't have to worry about him rolling off.  My baby was colicky for his first few months, but this pad was the only place (beside our arms) where he would cry.  I called it the Magic Pad because it was really a life saver for my sanity.  At 6 months, we still use this for every diaper change.

Keep on our low wide dresser and change our babies there. No room for  a specific changing table and none needed... not like I am going to leave a baby unattended on either. Been using with twins for 9 months, and no significant wear. Tempted to get a second one when we move to a bigger place because we will be having baby 3 when twins are just 14 months, and it would be nice to have them in 2 locations to avoid waking other babies up when some are sleeping and some are screaming.

This changing pad did not fit our crib's changing table, but I used it everywhere else. It is great. It seemed very safe to place the baby inside of it. It was comfortable for her.This product serves it's purpose.We purchasedSummer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Sagefor it. We wash that when necessary with no issues.  I do believe that the cover is not necessary like some other reviewers have mentioned. The cover is a nice to have.

I got this because of all the great reviews but when I received it, I was very disappointed. It was very flimsy, not firm and felt like it would not last more than a month. Plus the plastic-y texture and smell was a big turnoff (even though you would cover it with a changing pad). I was surprised at the poor quality given the reviews but it is a good price. I returned it and got a naturepedic changing pad instead which was much more expensive ($99) but am glad I did - there is a world of difference but I guess it's always about getting what you pay for. The naturepedic one is FIRM, durable and very high quality. So if you are looking for a cheap throwaway pad, this could work but we were surprised at the poor quality - my fingers could touch when i squeezed it.

I have used this item everyday for my baby, and it still looks like new. It fits well on the dresser I put it on.It also fits all the covers I bought for it. It is soft and large enough for most babies. My 10weeks baby girl seems to enjoy lying down on this pad. We have had no complaints about this changing pad yet. This pad would probably be on my top 10 baby items if I creat such a list.

This fit our changing table perfectly (also purchased from Amazon - the DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer changer in Cherry - I could only find a link for the Espresso but it's the same thing)DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Espresso. The pad that comes with the changing table is pretty thin so I wanted to purchase one with more cushion. I also purchased a Boppy changing pad set in sage that fit perfectly. Our baby is due in May so we haven't use this yet but I'm very happy with the purchase!

So far, with two kids and two changing tables, we've had four of these pads.  They're durable and wipe clean (if you get a cover, you have to change the cover every time it gets soiled, instead of just wiping the waterproof pad clean--the kids seem not to mind if the pad is a little cold sometimes).  Over time, as the kids play with toys as they're being changed, and as the pad is moved around for cleaning, it'll develop small tears.We decided to replace both pads when kid #2 was born.  After about two years of daily service, the original pads could probably have gone on working for us, but we figured that replacing them made sense.  They'd more than earned their keep.  I expect the new ones to go strong for another year and a half at least.  When the time comes, if we need to replace them again, I will.  The price is right and they work so well.Bottom line:  These are good, sturdy changing table pads.

I bought this pad after such great reviews.  While the quality seems good, there is an awful toxic smell.  Maybe it's the plastic backing????  I've had to change my pad covers because they smell like some sort of fumes.  I've had the pad for 2 weeks now without the pad cover trying to air it out.  I'll update in a few weeks.  If the fumes aren't gone by time baby comes, I'll have to return.  Anyone else have this problem???Update - After a month of airing it out and washing it (never used it and baby not even here yet), the smell didn't go away so I returned.  I ended up buying a Serta at Babies R Us so I can smell it in person.  Not even close in comparison.  The Serta had no vinyl/chemical smell whatsoever.  I don't know how this pad gets such good reviews, unless I just got a lemon.  I love my new pad and know my baby is safe without all those chemicals.  Also, the smell really piqued my interest and did a little research.  Many changing pads are filled with polyurethane (flame retardant) which is known to cause "birth defects, cancer and reproductive problems".  I learned this via Amazon and the California Resident disclosure that must warn California residents if this chemical is used in any products.  Just beware.  I'll forgo the flame retardant that is pretty unlikely the changing pad would catch on fire while the baby is on it versus the harmful chemicals being exposed multiple times a day.  Just beware!

My wife and I liked this so much, we bought another one to set up a changing station downstairs and upstairs. We also bought the covers and change those out every week (or more often if our son has an ill timed pee). I don't really understand the safety strap since it's not like we leave him on it. Whenever using this, you should always be standing right next to your child, especially since most people set these up on changing tables, beds, dressers, and other high places.

This is the one to buy.  We have two of these for two changing tables.  The oldest one is now 3 years old and is used multiple times daily with a plush cover.  It has no rips and still supports and is great.  The contoured design is what you want to buy... it helps prevent your baby from rolling off.  Don't get me wrong, they can still roll off, but this makes it harder.  You still have to watch your child.  A great changing table pad.

I bought a changing table but it came with this flat little changing pad and I knew right away I would need another. After looking at several I finally decided on this one and I'm soo glad I did. It fits the changing table perfectly and with a changing pad cover over it its absolutely amazing. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

This works just fine. It has the best price, it's high enough on the sides for safety, it's water proof. If I had one complaint, it's where the sides curve upward. The vinyl fabric doesn't totally conform to the ramp/curve so there is a pocket of air where it should contour. No biggy though...and hardly noticeable.

I love the safety attachment that screws into the surface. I had a long dresser that match my nursery, my husband screwed the changing pad down and bought 2 covers for it. Waterproof and it also has the safety strap for just in case I need to let go of him for just a second and reach something. I use my changing pad in my nursery EVERY SINGLE CHANGE unless we aren't home of course. On of my favorite buys!!

This product helped me to extend the life of an old school changing table. It's easy to install and does its job. The one down side is you really need to buy the Carters changing pad cover with it. The plastic can get caught on your rings and puts you in danger of ripping the pad. The upside is the changing pad cover is super soft and made my 6 week old smile at the pattern. All in all a good buy.

This pad does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Makes a good, comfortable place to change your child.  I also like that it secures to the dresser, so my toddler cannot pull her little brother off the dresser by yanking on the pad.  We haven't had any problems with smells or staining that others have complained about, but we always use a changing pad cover. Maybe that's the difference?

Haven't used it because the baby's still in my wife (that sounds so awkward), but we assembled our Sundvik crib and changing table yesterday.  Afterward, we tried to put in the changing pad that was purchased for us at our shower.  It *barely* fits and the middle portion of the changing pad actually raises because it has to bend in order to make the tight fit.  Just FYI if anyone is intending to use this changing table!

This is a very functional and comfortable baby changing pad. It is soft and large enough for newborns and most babies though their first year of life. The contoured surface ensures the stability of your baby and prevents it from rolling over. The security fastener is useful with older babies, when they become capable of rolling over on their own. It's easy to position this pad on most flat surfaces, but you should try not to place it on wobbly or high pieces of furniture. You should also get a sufficient number of waterproof covers for it, as you'll definitely need them and go through them relatively quickly.

This is just a nice, standard, contoured changing pad. For the price, it really can't be beat. It fits on our changing table nicely and both of the covers I've purchased fit it snugly. It's not fancy and I'm not sure I'd use it without a cover (the vinyl isn't THAT tough and it would be cold on baby's bottom) but it's for diapers to be changed it -- it doesn't have to be fancy! Not surprised this is so popular.

The family and I are currently living in a nice little basement apartment of a house... with not a heck of a lot of room for baby gear at the moment.  Oh, we get by very well, but Baby is rooming with her parents and the changing table we were offered just did not have a potential home.So someone recommended to just get a changing pad I could just stick anywhere.This one is GREAT.  I was a little surprised at the size, but I don't mind it at all. It's very well on the bathroom counter and of course on my so far preferred place, the floor (so sue me, I'm nervous about Baby falling still).  Really, if you have enough room, you can stick this anywhere.  It's also very light, so can be flung anywhere out of the way only to be rescued--a plus for those first few chaotic days.The contours are indeed a blessing if Baby bum is to be changed up somewhere high, as well as the handy straps.The surface?  Just what a diaper changing station should be.  Soft, but sturdy... and very easy to clean, trust me.This is great for those who don't want to shove in a whole changing table, though this is all set up to be installed to a table. A wonderful buy.

We have been using this for about 2 years and it has held up well. It has anti-slip &#34;grip&#34; on the bottom but it doesn't really work that well. Comes with the option of screwing it into the table it is on but we didn't wan't to do that either. We ended up using 3M Command strips to attach it to the wood - this worked great. Now that we no longer use it as a changing pad/table it serves as a soft spot on the floor if my toddler rolls out of his toddler bed. Still serves a soft purpose!

This pad really is an amazing deal, I couldn't believe it when it came. It was about half the price as the ones at Babies R Us but definitely the same quality. All standard changing pad sheets will fit it perfectly. There is a strap and screw to attach it to the dresser, and the hooks (which no one ever uses) to keep the baby in place. The non-slip bottom also works great, the thing does not slide at all. I loved it so much I bought a second one for my vacation home

After looking at various changing pads we narrowed down to this one and we were right. It works well and belt straps is a very good and needed feature. We like it and use it multiple times (over 7 daily) every day. It can go on the top of a dresser (make sure to attach it to that surface using the screws provided or else it will fall off) or it can be used with some changing tables such as the one made by Graco.

Have been using this for 3 months. Certainly works well enough. Sitting on top of a chest of drawers it makes a good changing station. The two negatives. First, the belt (pictured above) really doesn't do anything useful and gets in the way. You can't belt your baby in while you pop into the next room because they can still roll the whole thing off. But then the buckles just get in the way. We cut it off. Also after about 3 months the rigid spine that prevented it from bending has gotten soft, so when you put the fitted sheet on it bends into a flat U shape. But it's not a huge problem.

The last one I had, included mounting strips which I used and was thankful for.

This changing pad has been a good product for what we paid for it.  We also have a $30 changing pad for our older child that seems to be not as sturdy as this one.  It's been good for the short time that we use it.  The main con with this product is that there doesn't seem to be much grip on the bottom of it.  It isn't too much of an issue now since it's being used for our newborn, but it would be nice to have a little more traction on the bottom so it doesn't slide all over the dresser.  It has been manageable; and again, it's been good considering how inexpensive it was.

I have had this product and used it several times a day for a year and a half.  The actual pad is high quality and has maintained it's shape.  It is padded enough that it protects your little squirmy baby from bumps.  We have had a few extra messy diaper changes that have gone through the cover that I put on it and the changing pad easily wipes clean.  I then run a Clorox wipe over it and I have never had a problem with staining or any lingering odors.The safety features are really what drop the pad down to a four star rating for me.  It comes with screws to attach it to your dresser.  I just never understood the point of this, and on top of that I didn't want to ruin my furniture.  I haven't had a problem with the changing pad moving around.  However, the design could be improved by putting a few rubber pads on the back to prevent any sliding.  Also there is that silly belt on it.  What the heck is that going to do but get in your way?  Bottom line, you should never EVER leave your child unattended at the changing table.  The belt provides a false sense of security for parents.

This works perfect for what I need. I set it on the top of a dresser and it's just the right size. It seems quite sturdy and like it will last. Just be sure to let it air out a while because it smells strong like plastic.

Decent changing pad, but I wish I would have waited a week to order it.  Was $24 when I bought it and by the time I received it it was listed at $15.  :(Still a good product, but I could have used that $10 on other things for baby.

We have two of them, and it works great! We never use the belt thing, though. It seems pretty plush and comfy. Baby never complains when he's on it. =)

I have had this for 2.5 years and it still looks great.  It hasn't broken down in any way.  I don't use it nearly as much as I did when my daughter was small - it's more of a brief place to sit her after a bath and drying off- but it was one of the items I used every day, several times a day before.  I used it to dress her, change diapers, dry off after a bath, place lotion, you name it.It has held up well enough that I will soon be putting it away in hopes of passing it on to my brother and SIL should they need it some day soon.

I use this changing table constantly. It fits right under our bassinet and I can easily grab it to change baby. The ridges on the sides keep baby safe from rolling over the edge. I don't really ever use the buckle since most baby clothes need to be unsnapped, adjusted, and removed - but it is a nice feature. I keep a changing pad cover and waterproof liner with it and it's practically mess-proof.

Have two of these for our now 6 month old son. One upstairs and one downstairs. Both are on a folding table, as I found that combo about $200 cheaper than buying a dedicated changing table that we won't need in another year.Pros:- Soft pad that I feel comfortable changing him on. He's not going to roll off easily due to the contoured shape.- It's relatively non-moving, though it does slip around a bit if we push hard. We solved that by putting down some drawer liner material that keeps it right in place.Cons:- Worthless straps. They lasted the first use, when he peed on them, and I realized there's no way to clean them. I cut them off and we're just fine without them. Honestly, the concept of strapping him down for every changing falls apart when you get to the real world.

This is a contoured changing pad--nothing more, nothing less.  It fits in a standard-sized changer, and it accommodates typical-sized covers.  Can't go wrong with that.  It's not luxurious, but I'm pretty sure getting your diaper changed isn't supposed to be a day at the spa.  (And if you want it to be, get a fancy, plush cover and no one would be the wiser.)  In a perfect world, I'd be gung-ho about an organic changing pad.  But in my world of finite resources, I'd rather use this pad and save my pennies to buy an organic crib mattress, given the amount of time the baby spends on each surface.  My one actual complaint about this purchase isn't about the changing pad itself--it's about the packaging Amazon used to mail it.  It came inside a very reasonably-sized box that was then placed inside an enormous box (seriously, big enough for my 8.5 months-pregnant self to sit inside) full of packing paper.  Given that this was just about the least fragile item I've ever ordered from Amazon, I was surprised by the waste.  Overall, though, this purchase gets a thumbs-up!

This pad works great for us.  It fits perfectly on our table and so far has been everything we could ask for in a changing pad.  It is waterproof and easy to wipe down for those inevitable changing table accidents.  My daughter is a big fan of peeing while on the changing table and I have never had a problem with cleaning up messes off this pad.I have never been bothered by any weird  chemical smells emanating from it.I use the soft green summer infant changing pad cover and they fit the pad perfectly.

great size and it's waterproof without feeling stiff and uncomfortable. my changing pad cover fits well. i really like that it comes with a screw to secure it to the back of whatever dresser/table you're using because we don't have a changing table with raised sides (although i guess you could figure out how to secure it on your own, but i was wondering how i'd keep the changing pad on the dresser, and this made it very obvious which i needed :) ).

I ordered this along with the changing pad cover to go on a changing table I purchased for my grand son. I love the way it has a seatbelt and the curves on the side to protect my grand son from rolling into the side of the railing . This is a great buy. No regrets but highly recommend this item. Perfect fit for a perfect baby.

I like the nice high sides of this changing pad. Our daughter never rolled around too much while being changed, but the contoured pad really discourages it. The size is really large and accommodates her nicely now that she's almost 2. My only complaint is that the vinyl has started to flake off in places. We often used it without a changing pad cover because the vinyl wipes clean so nicely, but now we usually keep it covered because of the chipping so she doesn't put it in her mouth. In addition, most covers for the pad are kind of pricey (usually $15 and upwards, making owning several of them cost prohibitive). We have found a receiving blanket fits great as a cover, with a couple small pieces of velcro on the bottom of the pad to hold it in place. I would buy this product again.

Date: 04 28, 2013
I love that this product is semi-firm so that it's comfortable for baby to rest on while I'm changing her, but it's still firm enough that she's not sinking into it. I got the thinnest pad with my changing table which was basically no different to laying my baby girl on the wood of the changing table, it was also completely flat and didnt have the contoured edging of the summer infant changing pad that helps to keep baby at the center of the pad. Obviously you will always want to keep a hand on your baby when changing them, but you'd be surprised how much the slight curves of the edges help you when they want to flail! I know that others have said that they didn't buy the covers, but I bought covers because the plasticy cover of the changing pad gets really cold at night, and it's already hard enough to keep baby happy during a change without laying her down on a cold surface. The cloth of the cover just helps her be a little more comfortable, and it's a lot easier to throw that in the washer than go get a cloth and wash the actual changing pad and then disinfect it! I'm very satisfied with the product! :)

We purchased a more expensive pad from PBKids for other babies, but seeing as it is in storage, I made this purchase in a pinch.  It does not seem to &#34;lay&#34; very well. Maybe once the baby comes and is changed on it over time it will improve.  For now it bubbles up in the middle and will not flatten down on its own.

Best-changing-pad-ever.  We bought two of these for the two changing tables in the house.  I love that it is curved to help keep baby in place (although, it is getting harder and harder to keep our squirmy worm of a baby in place as she gets bigger!).  The buckle comes in VERY handy for our moving baby!

I bought this to use on my Davinci Monterrey Changing table since the pad it came with was very thin.  I was able to secure the safety strap to the table using the included strap and screw with no problem.  Love the contoured sides, which in addition to the buckle, discourage a squirming baby from rolling off the table.

Perfect changing pad for my nursery. When the pad is attached to the changing table (or dresser in our case) via the safety strap, there is no problem with the pad moving or sliding. It cleans easily and the changing pad covers we bought fit. Holding up well so far and it's been in use multiple times daily for 5 months.

I bought this for my newborn to use on his dresser. I never did. I moved it into the living room and tucked it beside the couch so maybe then I could remember to use it when I changed him in the living room. I still never used it. Me and my husband were never freaks about where we changed our baby in our home. I just changed him where we were; on the bed, couch, and even the floor on a soft blanket. I think if you're not one of those "change him on a pad" people then you will rarely remember to use it. The few times we did it felt durable though.

I love this changing pad and am so happy that I purchased it. I recently purchased a new changing table and wanted this pad for its large size, high walls, and thickness of the padding. I didn't realize that the new changing table that I bought came with a pad, but I tossed it because it was only about an inch thick. This pad is extremely padded and will be super comfortable to change the baby on. I would recommend this to anybody.

I have two of these, and they are great.  They have maintained their shape quite well even through heavy use.  They are covered with a waterproof wipeable fabric, which is great to have as a last defense if there is an accident that soaks through the cover I use.  I definitely would recommend this changing pad.

Bought this because it had better reviews than other changing pads and I was not dissapointed. I didn't think it had a strange odor like some others did, so I was pleased with that. The material used to cover it does sound a little trash-baggish because of the waterproofing, but the cover I bought for it covers the sound too. The only thing I wasn't excited about was that the pad covering was bent at one time or another, and will not lie flat & contoured like the picture. I'm sure it will work itself out once I put a baby on it every day, but it's not something I was expecting in a brand new pad. It looks like baby has plenty of room to grow with it also.

For the price you really can't beat it. It's huge but I measured this before I bought it to make sure it would fit our changing station- which it does. Measure first, people, before you saw it doesn't fit.  It's sturdy and as for the straps, either cut them off if you don't like them OR, do what I did, and tuck them under the side furtherest from  you. I tucked it to the side along the changing pad cover. Great product.

This is a terrific changing pad! It is spacious and we love that it is waterproof. I guess it is pretty comfortable too because our son actually settles down when we put him down on it sometimes.

We've been using this changing pad for a month now and so far we like it.  I put down a sheet of that shelf liner (the one with holes in it you can pick up at the dollar store) to keep it in place on the dresser. It doesn't move which is a definite plus.  baby seems comfortable on it.  We do not have a cover for it but instead use adult incontinence pads that can be thrown out so we're not constantly washing covers.  the only downside I can say is that the very first day we got home and we didn't have the pads to put down, baby pooped a little on the changing pad. I have not been able to get the stain out and I've tried bleaching the spot to no avail.  Worth the purchase though, just make sure you have something to go over it before putting baby on it.

I bought one of these pads on sale to keep in our car -I hate how dirty many baby changing areas are when out and about (and sometimes they aren't available at all) so for the sale price of around $20 I thought this would be worth buying and keeping in the car (if you have a big enough vehicle to do a diaper change anyway, we can fold a seat down). Best idea ever. I use a soft Carter's cover on it, and it's great. I have a baby who is very big for his age so I love it that this pad is nice and long.  In fact, since it's still on sale I am going to buy another one to keep downstairs in my house (pregnant again and having some issues that make it hard to get around, so for this price it will be worth it to have a spare pad downstairs). This pad is actually longer than the one currently on my baby's changing table, and really my son is getting too big for the table anyway...this pad will be more comfortable than just changing him on the floor. I recommend this pad for the price. Do cover it though, I recently noticed that my upstairs pad has a small tear in it, and I always keep it covered.  Keeping a cover on it should at least help minimize tearing, but at least you can wipe this down nicely if and when needed.  Also, if you get one of these for the car, it would probably feel cold to the baby in the winter months, so you do still want to buy an extra cover.

Works perfectly for diaper and clothes changes for our newborn on top of her dresser. The contour edges are great and make me feel safer putting my baby on it. I also bought the Summer infant plush covers to use over top so i dont mind the quilted sort of texture of the actual pad. But even if i didnt, it would be easy enough to clean with wet wipes if it got soiled. I use the covers so the pad doesnt feel as cold for baby.

I bought this primarily for changing my baby in the car! I have a Honda CRV and the seats aren't flat (nor should they be) which makes changing his diapers such a production! The back trunk surface is too hard and uncomfortable for him, so I just place him on this pad and changing him is a breeze! My son wiggles and rolls when I change him, so I love that it contours and buckles him in. It's very cushy and the surface is so easy to clean (with just a regular wet wipe). Great for our vacations and trips in the car!

I needed a replacement changing pad for a changing table we already had.  This works fine.  The pad does seem a little hard but baby doesn't seem to mind.  It also stained easily when my daughter had a diaper blow out and the spots remained even after cleaning with a lysol wipe.  I didn't notice any strong odors coming front he pad like others have commented on.  The changing pad covers we already had (not Summer brand) fit on this pad perfectly.

I'm a nanny and former i/tod teacher as well as mother. This is my favorite style of changing pad. You need every bit of help you can get keeping the little ones from rolling off. When they starting turning over-this gives you a little extra protection. NEVER leave a baby unattended-even strapped in. Always keep on hand on them. This is a good quality, pad. You need to buy a cover separately.

Great price, and very sturdy. I even got an extra one to use as a baby's co-sleeper. My husband sleeps very deep, and I put this in between us, so baby can sleep in our king size bed without being disturb. Much much cheaper than the store co-sleepers usually runs about $30 to $50!

Surprised how much I needed the contoured sides as my daughter tried to roll away from diaper time.  We also use the strap to secure it to her dresser and the buckle to keep her in place.  Both work fine.  Soft, good length.  She is about 2 ft. 4 in. now and still fits on it.  We pair it with the Summer Infant Ultra Plush change pad cover which is warmer for her to lie on than the pad itself.  We also use the Boppy changing pad liners which are the best investment ever.  We are able to wash the liners when they get anything on them and bring them with us for travel while protecting this very good pad.  Would buy again.

Large and durable-feeling product. The Carter's Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover fits perfectly over this product.Comes with a screw in case you want to screw it into your changing table. We are just placing this on top of a dresser and using that as a changing table.

I got this off of my Amazon baby registry.  It serves it's purpose well, we use it with a soft cover.  The contour shape is great for keeping my newborn in it.  It also fits great on my dresser, in front of the mirror so my newborn loves to stare at himself. The only downfall is that it's made from polyurethane foam, but I figure that since I use a cover and he's not on it for very long it's fine.

Yes, some of them do have a residual smell and it does stink if you put your nose to it. I let it air out and it's fine now. It's a nice pad. I think it's the right 'plushness' as it's not too soft that you can't do anything with it but not too hard that the poor child is freaking out.I sewed my own cover for it by just tracing it on extra fabric I had. Any spills and I just wash the cover and wipe that sucker off, I appreciate how easy it is to clean. Fits well in my changing table and I like the contoured sides. Good price for it being new.Update:After using this for 4 months, here's what I've noticed-It gets much softer after being used for a while, but still keeps its shape-If you don't have a cover and use it, be careful of getting anything from the diaper on it. The texturing has a design of tiny circles that are depressed and baby messes easily get in them and will dry without you knowing. They're small enough to where you can't get it clean with a wet wash cloth unless you really scrub. It's a little irritating because I don't see it being dirty initially and then I have to spend about 10 minutes cleaning it up.But, it still is great to have, it fits nicely on the changing table and gives my baby enough comfort during changings.

I like the contoured feature of this changing pad. I never screwed it down as instructed so perhaps that's why I'm not experiencing the problems the folks who gave this 1 star did. I did not purchase a cover either. Just throw a cloth or towel over it and it works great. You don't have to worry about elastic bands, etc. Baby stays put and doesn't twist or turn while on the pad. For $15, it gets the job done well.

When I was registering in a baby store for my baby shower I was kind of shocked at the price tag of many of the changing pads I looked at. They ranged from $30-75 and I could not see not feel any discernible difference among them. When I found this changing pad on amazon I was a bit skeptical but the reviews were great so I decided to give it a try. I am not disappointed and have since bought another to use at the grandparents' house. This a good quality changing pad! I do recommend taking it out of the packaging and allowing it to air out for a day. I didn't detect any strong odor but I tend to let most baby items that can't be washed air out.

This is a good product but it is bigger than imagined. The cover I purchased for it said it would fit this size of a pad, but the pad was still way too big...might not be the size it is described as. The cover rolled up on the corners due to its size. The pad does not fit my changing table and is way too big by about 3-4 inches. My changing table is standard and fit a generic pad sold from a local baby store. It's ok but make sure that your changing table will fit this large changing pad.

This pad turned out to be too long and I decided to shorten it myself. In order to do so I had to unstitch one side to get to the foam. I was shocked how cheaply this one is once I saw the inside. The hard part on the bottom is a regular brown cardboard, so first it can absorb moisture and second you can easily damage it. The foam is a regular foam with glued on triangle sides. The smell was just awfully toxic like the pad wasn't meant to be touched.Overall if you don't see what I saw it looks somewhat decent, though the vinyl cover sticks out a lot (not a snug fit). If you put a cover on it it will look just fine.

I do not use the straps, really, babies get strapped into everything. I have this for a changing station on my dining room table for my Grandson.  It is a safe, cosy, secure place to change him.  It is also easy to clean since I bought a velour cover that pops into the washer.

We ordered this changing pad because it was half the price of a similar one that we found in Target. Changing pads aren't something that you really need to pay up for a 'top of the line' model. They all pretty much accomplish the same job. Save your money and order this one.

Our first visit from our grand baby and his parents - the one request was that they have a place to change baby's diapers.  I'd seen a similar pad at my niece's house, so explored Amazon site for a similar product.  Voila! Found exactly what I wanted along with a couple of pad covers.  We set everything up nicely on my desk in the study, and got rave reviews from mom and dad.  Thanks Amazon, for making shopping so very easy, with on time delivery and the option of a Prime account.

After my husband nearly dropped our baby changing him directly on a dresser, I decided a contour changing pad would ease my mind.  Just the curve seems to hold our wiggly, active 5 month old in place.  We don't use the strap and recently cut them off since they were catching on the drawers of the dresser.  I do use a changing sheet/pad on to of the pad for ease of cleaning.  The price and size of this pad was ideal.  Try it out.

We use this changing pad many times each day. We recently went on a 17 hour trip away from home (2 days' worth of travel), and took this along in the back of the SUV. We put this on the seat so little one wouldn't roll toward the back of the seat when being changed. Worked like a charm! We also would put it on the bed at the place where we were staying and it was nice to have something familiar to put the baby on in a place she wasn't used to. Now it's back in its home on the changing table, and we love it. Would recommend it to anyone with a little one needing diaper changes.

This is a great product, it is simple and is just what we needed. We put this on top of our dresser to make a changing table for our son. They sell covers, but that seems silly. This wipes down easily and is probably easier to clean without a cover, they would just add laundry. Buying a whole new piece of furniture seems like a waste. Just use this and transform something you already own.

I have read quite a few reviews that talk about this changing pad breaking down or falling apart after just a few uses and so I was a little nervous about this purchase. But I bought it back in May of 2011 before our daughter was born in June and so we've been using it many times a day for almost 10 months now and I've never had a problem! I use a cover on it and don't use the strap (Ok, I admit, I cut the stupid strap off. Does anyone really use those at home?!)Note- We cloth diaper and because all of our supplies are in her room we really do use this changing pad multiple times a day, every single day. We're not 'anywhere' changers just because that is not practical with cloth.I love the angle that it contours upwards at, even with all my girls wriggling around she has never come even close to rolling off of it (I don't tempt fate by leaving her unattended though- I really don't suggest that!) when I take a quick step away to toss her dirty diaper and insert in the pail.I have been very happy with this purchase.

I wanted a nice thick changing pad and this met all of my expectations and more! I couldn't believe how much more expensive they were at other Baby Stores.

I bought this item because I really needed a comfy, wet-proof spot to lay my son down (I have a changing area in a room of the house that has a cold concrete floor underneath). I haven't gotten around to getting a changing table yet. My only complaint is that you really must use one of those contoured changing pad COVERS to protect it. The changing pad could easily be punctured from my dog or my son stepping on it. It is showing wear from days that I didn't have a cover on it and my dog or my son walked on the pad. I have the feeling that if it got a hole in it and urine seeped into the hole, I would want to toss the whole pad!

I've had this product for about a month, and I cannot believe that I went without it for the first three months of my baby's life!  I love that it is contoured so that my baby is safely tucked in there and it has a waterproof liner.  I actually don't use a cover with mine, but it's super easy to clean with just a damp cloth.  It also does come with straps for the baby and screws to affix the pad to your changing table.  The only thing that was different than what I expected was the shape of the pad.  The contours are more blunt than rounded, but it keeps my baby in place, and that's all the matters.  Overall, a good affordable product!

This is a good changing pad:It is easy to clean, it is thick and comfortable, the contoured featured is definitely a nice feature for that little time where the kids can wiggle and roll and before they figure out how to crawl.I never really used the strap and clip to hold the baby down. I had tucked in under the pad for a while which was a mistake on my part as it scratches the top of the dresser/changer. After that I just secured the strap/clip by tucking it in the changing pad cover sides.The only small complaint I have is that if you look at the patterns, all those little dots create weak points which over time will just break. My pad is torn in many places after 1.5 year of use because those little holes created tears - just like say perforated paper would behave.

Decent changing pad. I run a home-based daycare so mine has more frequent use than normal, so the pad would last longer for others than for me. I have to replace every few months- I have found that it cracks with use. For daycare, we can't have any tears and cannot use a cloth cover. If you have a cover, this pad may actually last a very long time.The contouring discourages baby from rolling completely over. I personally don't use straps- I will not turn away from a baby on a raised surface, so they are pointless for me. Therefore, I cannot rate the strap quality.I think you get a good product for the money, as this is one of the least expensive models of this thickness that I have come across. When the waterproof layer cracks, I will order another of the same.

This does great!!  We use PeeWees disposable covers with this and the two have been great!!  The size is large that we should get many years of use.  I would recommend this to anyone!!**Update Nov 2011** We have been using this since our child was born and it is still in top condition!  We used the safety strap and attached it to the wall with a heavy screw - it stopped our son from kicking the table over when I reached for his clothes that were located behind me.  We also use it in the bathroom to lay him down after his bath - makes it easier to put his dipe back on and get him dried off.  We still highly recommend this item :-)

The changing pad that came with our diaper changing station was very thin and flimsy. This was the most reviewed and popular product in its category, so I quickly placed an order for it. I didn't notice any &#34;smell&#34; as others have experienced, it seemed fine to me. The cover doesn't fit snugly around the foam, however, and I don't like that it has a perforated sewing pattern on it, much like a quilt. If you have accidents, stuff will seep into the pad and the cover becomes very difficult to clean (already happened once). I skipped the changing pad cover and bought a set of Munchkin Liners here on Amazon, and they are working great to prevent any more messes from getting onto the pad itself. As for the size, it's a perfect fit for standard size changing stations.

No extra bells or whistles on this item. It does exactly what you need it to. We secured it properly to the back of our changing table, but we have yet to use the buckle strap and our little one is 6 months old. I know it is for extra safety, but the curve is deep enough that she doesn't try to roll while on it. I would suggest keeping a hand on them anyway, but you may not need the strap. It is comfortable and fits all covers nicely. I have a few different brand covers and they all work.

I bought this along with a cute velvety cover for my son. I found out instantly that leaky boys=the cover needs washed often. This pad itself is made of waterproof fabric so I just started using this without the cover. After about a week, the pad was stained and gross. Not even bleach could remove the discolored areas.  The fabric is very porous.  Also, the vinyl ripped on us! I ordered the LA Baby changing pad next and it works great without the cover. 2 months and it looks brand new still.

I never realized how much I depended on this changing pad until I went out of town for a week and had to change my 7 month old on flat surfaces!  He moved and turned so much it was hard to keep him down.  The changing pad makes it hard for him to turn, making it easier for your to change him. I don't use any of the straps. I doubt they would hold him down anyway. If there's any doubt in your mind of whether you'd need one or not..YOU DO!  If not this brand, any other brand will do.

I got it for my changing table - its a little to long and I have to really smash it to put on the top of the table. But on the back I have extra few inches which is fine as I can put lotion and stuff, but not enough to put wipes so I still have to get organizer to have them next to me.  I always use waterproof pads on the top of the cover so I didnt get a chance to check how water resistant it is but I believe so. Overall I like it, but giving it 4 stars for not fitting my table.

This changing pad is great. It fits our daughter well and should until she is out of diapers. I made a liner to go over it that's contoured the same and it looks great in our room. I love the contour as it keeps her on the pad now that she's squirming and trying to roll over while being changed :)  The bottom is advertised as non-skid, however it's not tacky and really isn't very effective.  We've taken a small rug mat and put that under the pad to prevent it from sliding around.

This was a reasonable price and the covers are nice for it.  I never really used the strap on it (but if you don't leave baby, do you really need it?).  The shape of it keeps baby from rolling, which is helpful.  It would be nice if it were longer.

We've used this changing pad throughout my daughter's first year, and it has seen some messes - and come out strong. It's inexpensive, extremely durable, and the contoured sides really do help keep your child on the pad.

The generous size of this pad, as well as the contoured edges are really great.  While baby is still too young to be rolling around those edges make it seem more secure and even though she isn't moving we use the safety strap if we have to turn our backs or step away to grab something.  There is also an extra strap with screw that can be used to secure the pad to the changing table to keep it secure and not move around.  Should get a long use out of this because of the size, looks like you could put a pretty large baby/child on this to change.  We also got theSummer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Pinkalthough it isn't necessary .... but sure looks pretty in pink!Definitely for home use - visit to grandma etc. - as it isn't a portable changing pad.

My baby finds this pad so comfortable that we call it her, "baby lazy boy recliner". Sometimes we even take it into the living room for her to lay on when she is fussy. The pad is long so be sure to measure your table.

We set this on a small dressor to use it as our changing table. It has a small strap with a screw on the back to attach it to the back of a table or dressor so it will remain stable. It also has a strap one can use to secure baby. The shape is nice as it cradles baby to help keep her from rolling off. Excellent pad, no negatives. Get a nice soft cover to keep your baby happy during the diaper changes.

We purchased this before my daughter was born to be used on her changing table. It wipes clean easily, the raised sides help keep baby from trying to roll while you change her and its light weight so its easy to move. The only bummer is my daughter is getting tall enough that her feet hang off the end now (very tall little one) so we may have to retire it soon.

If you are looking for a great inexpensive changing pad, get this product.  I saw some reviews complaining about the quality.  I am not sure what they expect for the price you are paying and I am not sure what you expect for a changing pad?  We just used an old dresser in our babies room and this fits perfectly on top.  We bought several changing pad covers and it looks great and works perfectly!

This pad is nice and thick and wipes off very easily if you decide to change them directly on it if you're washing your other covers.  I don't do this too often but when I have too it's perfectly fine.  For the price you are getting a high quality, durable changing pad considering the one that came with our changing table was a piece of junk.  Don't search too hard and long for a changing pad cause this one is very good.

Our baby has always loved to lay on this pad for whatever reason.  When she was a fussy newborn I would let her lay on it and turn the shower fan on for white noise.  (She never slept on the pad or was left unattended) and she would calm down.  She loved to sleep on her back from the start, so convincing her to do tummy time was a little rough- until one day when she was a little over 1 mo I put her on her tummy on this pad.  I think because the material is soft and supportive, she felt really secure.  So with every diaper change (that is a LOT )  I  would give her some tummy time right afterwards, and she loved it!  She got very strong and stable quickly.  Now she is 6 mo and crawling, but I still use this pad daily for changing diapers.

This hasn't had a lot of use yet, as my newest baby is only a week old.  But it seems to be of very good quality.  I will update in time if it turns out not to be.  This is the 4th pad I have bought - they all seem to end up looking like they were attacked by wolves in short order.  With my son we went through a Rumbletuff one and a Simmons one - and he was trained by 2 1/2.  With my twin girls I managed to make a simmons last 3 years but it looks horrible (cracked) and with all the foam exposed like that, even if it's covered pee can get in so I wanted a new one for #4, expecting lots of newborn peeing on the table.  This pad has a cover like a nice quality shower curtain, not the paper-thin stuff of other pads I have used.  It really seems like it will hold up better.However - it's huge!  I know I could have read the description but I assumed they were standard.  None of my old covers fit this.  I have to buy new covers now.  Luckily it will just barely fit into my changing table.  It's at least a good 2-3 inches bigger than my old pad.I see the Simmons pad is listed as being the same length as this one so maybe all pads have gotten longer.  Maybe kids are training later?  It's not a big deal if you are starting from zero but if like me you are upgrading an old pad you might be surprised!  You can get by without a cover but it looks and feels nicer and I think prolongs the life of the pad.  So measure your old pad to be sure.Embarassing update - I have come to realize it's not so much my old pad was that much smaller - it was SLIGHTLY smaller, not a lot - but my old covers had shunk so much they had squashed the pad from end to end!  The cotton terry covers are nice but they shrink a lot over time I guess.  I have the Summer soft synthetic covers for this pad now and while I don't like the lack of absorption for pee accidents, they are growing on me and wash very well.  Pad is holding up well so far, has only been a couple months though.

I dont know why but a lot of covers that we have simply dont fit this well, causing a pooling or bunched up effect.  I am not sure if the contour feature adds anything important to the usability but overall a great product. Firm but not hard (if that makes sense).I had a dear friend use this as a baby bed for co-sleeping. They had a relatively firm bed so it worked well for them. It didnt work well for us with a medium density mattress. Also- with a husband that weighs a lot more than me- the pad caused my little one to tilt way too much towards my husband. Simply having no insert for cosleeping works the best.

We bought a changing table and needed a pad to go on top. I didn't want to spend $35+ in the stores so I'm glad I waited and looked on Amazon. This price was great and I read through the reviews to make sure it wasn't a 'you get what you pay for' item. I am very pleased with the pad. It is very lightweight and I love the contoured sides. It fits our changing table perfectly (I measured it first though) and our changing pad covers fit perfect too! Glad I made the purchase!!

This changing pad is a great.  The only reason I  did not give it 5 stars is because of how it attaches to a dresser.  I do not have a changing table that has a rail on all 4 sides to hold it in.  Instead I have this sitting on top of my babies dresser where you are supposed to screw straps into the back to keep it on top securely.  The problem is there is only one security strap and it is in the center.  Other models had at least 2 straps that could snap on and off and were located at either end of the pad.  I know that it will not fall off the dresser, but this allows the pad a lot of wiggle room side to side and front to back.  It does not feel firmly in place at all.  This could have been easily solved by having a strap on both ends of the pad instead of one in the center, or by making the bottom a non-skid type of material.  I may add straps of my own to make sure this stays securely in place while changing a wiggling baby.

When you take this out of the package the first thing that you are going to notice is the smell. It's very strong, and chemical-y.I knew going in to purchasing this product that it would be an issue for us. However, the price makes it worth it. Our baby won't be spending a lot of time just hanging out on here, and there will be a cover to help protect his delicate skin.I really couldn't justify spending $100 on a natural version of this product even though everything in our house is organic/natural.It takes quite a bit of time to have the smell go dissipate... about a month or so.Other than that, it feels cheaply made but what can you expect for 14 bucks?

Haven't had any issues with this changing pad - it does the job! It's soft and more cushy than the horrible flat pads that come with the changing tables. I love that it's countered and makes my baby feel more secure. This was so much cheaper than the one in Babies, so this was a great deal.

Very good product. When I purchased it, I didn't really measure my changing table because I thought these things were standards. Well, it's not. Lol it arrived on time, in great qualify, but it was a tiny bit longer than the table. Ended up staying with the same table and keeping it super squeezed in there. Lol after using it for a while, I actually realized, it is much better to be bigger as they grow so fast... But it is a great product, didn't seem right not to use it.

I used this for my first child before I realized how toxic vinyl is to breathe in.  When you set the baby down, all the air gets pushed out of the holes in the pad after you've used it for a while.  Did you ever notice that vinyl things smell bad when you get them?  That is what is bad for you.  If you're going to use this because of the price, at least use a thick cover with a pad underneath to minimize breathing it in.  If you don't believe me, do some research on it.Amazon sells a cloth one by LA Baby for $28 - if you can afford it, get it.  If not, I would say just use your bed or your couch with a waterproof pad or a changing blanket.Without mentioning the vinyl issue, mine did begin to crack and get sharp edges after about six months of use.  We ended up throwing it out and just changing on the bed with a changing pad underneath.

We keep it on our changing table and I love the straps so I can strap in our baby when needed.It's nice and thick, and the contoured sides help keep the baby in the middle of the pad. It wipes clean, though I made a couple of soft covers that can be thrown in the washing machine very easily.Would definitely buy this changing pad again.Update: May 2014Our changing pad is now 3 years old and still in perfect condition! We bought it for our 3rd child and are now using it with our 4th. Love it!

Well, our little boy arrived a week ago so we have gotten a lot of use out of this changing pad and are using it more and more every day. It appears to be very durable and comes with what seems to be a waterproof type covering which now that I think about it is a necessity..! HA! We've already had one accident but we did buy the extra fuzzy cover so that just went in the wash. The baby is usually very calm and we love the strap when we forget the diapers in the other room. The only issue that we have, which has nothing to do with the design of the product is that it slips easily on our very smooth/glossy top dresser so we just bought some of that sticky rubber stuff from Big Lots that keeps stuff from slipping, just to be extra cautious. The pad itself feels like it is more of an air mattress than a dense foam but I could be mistaken. Either way, the baby seems comfortable in it and it makes a great alternative to using the floor to change our little guy. A great product for the price and something I would suggest for any new parent!

We've been using this few times a day for a coulpe of weeks now and it's pretty good for what it is.  It keeps the baby from moving around too much and the vinyl is easy to clean.  However, for a piece of foam with a vinyl cover, it's a few bucks too much.  And I can't imagine ever using the safety belt.

I love this product.Durability- Firstly, after 14 months of intensive use the pad is still in a great condition!Saves space- It is light and easy to move from a room to room. It can be kept on a bed or a table. I don't have much space. So its a better option than the changing station which adds to one more furniture item in the house.safety-  Its contoured sides prevents the baby well from slipping down. The strap also does the job nicelyversatility- For first three months my daughter frequently took nap on the pad. I added some sheets to make it more plush. It was a convenient arrangement for both of us. I could keep her on bed next to me without putting her on our sheets and without any risk of my hand or my comforter falling on her. Again the sides protected her from slipping down on our bed. I could also put the pad in the living room where she can lie down and enjoy our company. I know there are bassinets and other stuff for this purpose but this pad was lighter and cheaper option. after three months she started sleeping in her crib and we started using this only as the changing pad.

Instead of buying a changing table, since we already have a couple suitable dressers with nice wide flat tops, I decided to try going with a changing pad.  I did a lot of research and reviews reading and found this one.  I really like it.  It's long enough to handle a growing baby and the sides do curve nicely.  Since it is a bit longer than many standard changing pads, I decided to just buy a few receiving blankets to use as covers, and they work wonderfully - if I get anything on one, I just use Bio-Kleen Bac-Out as a pre-wash spray and toss it in with the dirty cloth diapers.  It's a great solution and now I want one that lives on top of my laundry table downstairs and in the baby's nursery (I have this one in our room on my dresser).  And it seems very sturdy for the price!

Okay mom's to be, I know you're looking for cute changing pad covers right now, but save yourself the money, you don't need one. Changing diapers is gross. It's so much easier just to change your baby on this and then wipe it with an antibacterial wipe. This is a great product. To secure mine to the dresser top I used big Velcro circles I got from Wal-Mart. It helps keep it from sliding around without having to screw it into the dresser.

This pad works great. I got rubber cupboard liner and cut it to the size of the pad and then hot glued it to the bottom so the pad did not slide around on top of the dresser. If you are using a changing table you wouldn't have the issue but with a dresser it does slide around, the liner worked perfect.

I bought this changing pad since the one that came with my changing table was too thin and flat.  Since this one is contoured and thicker, I felt that this was more comfortable for my baby during his diaper changes.  It secured easily to my changing table and does not slide around at all!  I bought a changing pad cover for it just because my nursery theme is monkeys and there was a monkey cover.  You really don't need a cover since the pad is waterproof and easy to wipe clean.Compared to the changer that's attached to my Graco Pack n'Play, this pad is much better.  When my baby is sleeping and changed on the Pack n'Play changer, he immediately wakes up.  When he is changed on the changing table with the contoured changing pad, he stays asleep!I highly recommend!

I just received this changing pad in the mail a few days ago.  As for the shipping, I received it within 2 days.  The pad itself is also absolutely wonderful for the price.  It's very thick and looks like it is made nicely.  It also looks quite safe for a baby.  I had a Serta pad for my son, and this one looks just as great.  Actually, it looks much better at the moment, since the Serta pad looks extremely flattened when compared to this one, after using it for 2 1/2 years!  I am very pleased with this purchase and can't wait to use it for my new baby in a couple of months.  =0)

I bought this because a friend of mine got it. It is not to firm but not to soft either. It can hold weight and I love that most changing covers will fit it. My sister-in-law used it and she liked it. I can't wait to have my little one here to use it as well.

I love this changing pad! It is cushiony yet firm. It was horrible changing my baby's diaper on the bed at my parents house. I invested in one of these and it's been great! Makes changing my baby safe and easy. She also loves to just hang out on the changing pad while I dangle toys in front of her.

I purchased this changing pad to use on top of a desk when we lowered my daughter's crib mattress. Like other reviewers, I don't find it to be especially "slip proof". However, for our purposes, it does the job. I like that it's waterproof, and the restraints are a must for squirmy babies like mine!

This has been so great, we bought a second one for a second changing station in our house.  We put these on top of dressers or cabinets, rather than buying dedicated changing tables.  The contoured pad is great for keeping our newborns from rolling off, and the babies like the pads so well they sometimes fall asleep on them.  (So we then strap them in with the handy safety straps, put a blanket over them, and use the opportunity to get some work done.)  We can even pick up the whole changing pad, which has a firm bottom, and carry it with a baby on it to set the pad on the floor or take it to another room if needed.  Easy as pie, and so handy.

We love this changing pad.  It's plenty big, and it's great that you can attach it to your dresser, just for added security.  It fit our Aden + Anais standard-sized changing pad cover perfectly.

I had originally purchased a changing table, but the minimal pad you got was horrible, so I purchased this.  I was very pleased.  My granddaughter is now 20 months, in potty training, but I still have to use the changing table occasionally.  It has lasted well over a year and has maintained it's shape and cushioning.  I was very pleased with it.

This is one of those first time parent purchasing mistakes.  Now that I have a child, I recognize this item is a bad idea!  It is quilted - meaning it has tiny little holes punched in the outer plastic cover in the shape of adorable animals.  Cute - but not practical.  It can only be used with an additional cover, or it will be IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN.  And something that is impossible to clean is a really bad idea for a pad where you change poopy diapers!  Within a couple weeks of 10+ diaper changes per day, we had run out of clean changing pad covers (obviously).  This thing was immediately stained when when it needed to be used without a cover, and no amount of scrubbing can get rid of the stain.  While cleaning, some "material" got into those tiny little holes and I can not get it out.Anyhow, long story for a short recommendation: DO NOT BUY!  Get a changing pad that can be used without a cover if needed, and can be wiped clean easily.

I purchased this product as a replacement for a changing table pad.  It is sturdy and well made and definitely much better than the pad that actually came with the changing table.  It is a nice thickness and I like the raised edges.  It is very easy to clean and maintain.  I recommend this highly.

Love it.  Handy to place baby in for changing.  Baby is more relaxed because there he feels more secure when laying in this contoured changing pad.  So Baby is happy and then Mama is happy.  Easy to wipe clean.  I never use the straps because we are just in and out of the changing pad pretty quickly.  I never leave baby alone or look away. Remnder:  Make sure to purchase a pad cover to go with it.

You can certainly use this on a traditional changing table as well - but we stuck it on top of a dresser. The size and shape are universal to all changing pad covers, so you can customize it easily to fit your nursery decor. Cleans easily - we wipe it down every couple of weeks with Lysol wipes. Straps up top are easy to adjust, holding baby securely. The sides come up just enough that even my wiggly four month old feels secure on it. It's long enough to hold a much older baby also.

This changing pad gets the job done.  It's got good cushioning for a newborn and the contour is good for preventing the baby from rolling off the table.  I don't know what else you would need in a changing pad.  We put a cover on it and wash the cover regularly.  The pad itself is waterproof so it's easy to wipe down if needed.  Overall, great product for the price! You don't need anything &#34;fancy&#34; for a changing pad that your baby will probably poop/pee on daily. :)

Have not used it for my little one yet, but it is soft and looks cute with the cover. You need to buy the cover, otherwise you lay the baby directly on the vinyl. It seems a little large to me, but maybe that's how people like it. Comes with a strap that you can attach to the changing table, but honestly I find it unnescessary. I'm not going to leave the baby unattended on the mat and once any weight is placed on it, it is virtually slip proof. So we did not waste the time.

I actually bought my first one off of Walmart, but I bought a second one here.This changing pad is wonderful & I also have the plain covers (from Walmart) that are really soft. The changing pad is great for my newborn, & he can sleep on it whenever. I love that it fits well in his pack 'n' play. I can keep him in a safe place & he's slightly elevated so I can see him better.The contoured sides are going to be good for when he's older because he's a big mover. I haven't had to use the straps yet because he is a newborn, but I can tuck them into the covers easily enough so they're out of the way until the times comes when I need them.It's very easy to clean but has a few stains from some blowouts. I have washed it but the stains are still there, light though. Not a big deal really if you get the covers, which are a life saver when you use it as a mattress.

This fits my changing table (Badger basket sleigh style) perfectly and the straps go through the summer infant character change pad covers perfectly! They are easy to clean (I wipe down with a disinfectant wipe) when accidents happen. They are long to accommodate a growing baby and firm but supportive for increasing weight (my baby is 12 lbs now and no sagging on the pad).

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't know yet how durable or long lasting it will be. I will give it 5 stars at a later date if it holds up. Overall, great product!

I have been using this pad for 10 months (10 mo old baby) and I do like it, especially for the price. I paid $14 on Amazon. I do not use the straps and I feel the upward curve of the pad is enough to keep my baby in place. There is a plastic smell that is strongest when you first get it, but I kind of expect that from buying a cheap item made of plastic and foam.The only thing I don't like is the perforated holes/quilted pattern on the pad. These small holes allow liquid to get in. Most of my pad is white except for a few areas where my son peed through the pad cover and the urine got into the holes and discolored the foam to a light brown color.I have 2 changing pad covers and I alternate each week or as they get soiled. I would advise putting something waterproof between the pad and the cover to keep liquid from seeping into the small patterned holes.

I've been using this changing pad regularly for 3+ months and 20+/day. I am happy so far and have no issues. I highly suggest buying a cover for your changing pad.PROS:- Waterproof material: wipes away messes- Standard size: so you can use it for a long time while your baby is growing- Good value: compared to other changing pads, this price is very affordableCONS:- If you're not using the safety strap, it gets in the way. Some people (from the reviews I've read) cut this strap off because they think it's not needed.

My baby tends to squirm when changing and we used a non-contoured surface prior to this. Not the best idea. This pad is great. It is firm but soft enough so no suffocation concerns here, the two edges ramp up to keep him from rolling off the table. The pad has a protective covering so accidents will not seep into the material and it has a strap for the baby in case you really need it as well as a retaining strap so you can screw it down to the changing table or where ever. I put it on top of the dresser against the hutch wall so i didn't need to screw it down. Buying it from amazon was also cheaper than the store even with a coupon so that's great too. I recommend getting plush covers and pad liners if you tend to have a "peepee drive by" baby (he tends to try to pee on us during changes. Thus, I have the liners under him so I save the plush covers from a soaking and constant removal for laundry.

this fit nearly perfect in the changing table we got for the baby's nursery. its nice a padded so when my baby moves around he doesnt hurt himself. i LOVE how the sides are contoured upwards. my baby wont roll out when if i have to turn away for 2 seconds. also LOVE that it has a strap to clip him in. now that hes almost rolling over, it keeps him where he should be & not on the floor. this is a great product for people who use their changing table religiously like i do. i never change a diaper in any other place in our house.

changing pad is good, not excellent, but will serve it's purpose. The only thing I don't like about it is that the vinyl covering is a little loose on the pad, but a changing pad cover helps to tame it somewhat. The price was a lot lower than other brands, and since it's  only a changing pad and not a mattress, it's totally workable.

I wanted something that would strap to the furniture, but this product has a safety harness for the baby but not the product itself. They give your a single screw to screw into a wall or furniture. Won't work for me. The best furniture for this would be a changing station with high sides that supports it all around.

We actually own three of these:* One upstairs on a store-bought changing table. It's a little short actually, but it's handy to be able to slide it a few inches either direction depending on where baby landed.* One downstairs, on a thing I built out of MDF and screwed to the wet bar in our family room. I built the platform to fit this, so of course it fits great.* One in my wife's car, for when an on-the-road change is needed. I've used it in the back seat and the trunk both, as well as under the rear hatch of a Chrysler minivan we rented for vacation. My wife's car is a Camry, but the back seat really slopes and this makes it a lot easier.

We bought this to place on top of a dresser we have. It is nice and squishy so i imagine that it is quite comfortable. However, i am disappointed in this product for a couple reasons:1. It doesn't come with a cover. Trying to use it without one has several disadvantages.a. The plastic material that covers pad is perforated. All these little holes catch pee and poo in a way that is impossible to clean (even though it says that it is easy to clean).b. The plastic material can be cold against the baby's skin.c. The plastic is very thin and can be punctured easily. We had it a few weeks and the plastic on top ripped. We haven't done anything but change the baby on it.2. The plastic is slippery and can slip off the dresser. Even though this has a strap off the center of the pad which can be used to anchor the pad in place, it still slips all over the place. We have to use a rubber drawer liner under it to prevent it from slipping.Overall the changing pad does work. For the price you really can't beat it even with these two complaints I have. However, I would have been willing to pay a little more for the convenience of it being sold with a cover.

This product is a really good price. But it is softer & lighter material than the more expensive changing pads available in stores. I would have wanted something firm but for this price, it works for me. We haven't used this to change our baby yet though. Instead we put our baby in the changing pad and let him sleep next to mom on the bed in it. Eventually as he gets bigger & when we get our changing table, we will use it to change his diapers. The plastic cover does have a lot of quilting so it's best to not get poop on there. It's best to use the perfect-sized Dynarex underpads in addition to the changing pad cover. Our baby has peed a few times already while his diaper was open & being changed.

Well let's see - it's big enough, easy to clean, and the contours make it harder for a baby to fall off.What's ridiculous about it is the way they expect you to install the tethering belt attachments.  I believe it requires you to screw it in from both sides and then tighten each side.  I'm not making holes in my desk or table!  Seriously, was it not possible to make the belt harness around the table from the bottom and tighten up with a strap that way?  This would work for any elevated, flat surface that you could get your hand under from both sides (like any changing table you buy these days).

This item would probably be on my top 10 baby items if I even create such a list. It is quite versatile, holds up well and is very lightweight. We don't have one designated changing place in the house and tend to do it wherever we are during that part of the day so the pad is perfect for moving around. We also found out that the baby falls asleep very quickly  in it during the day and use it for short naps or to get him to quiet down, especially in his first few weeks. We now sometimes use it if we want to put him in the big bed in the morning when everybody is still waking up but we don't want to squish him too much - kind of like a co-sleeper except he spends less time in it. It is too soft for longer sleeping (and is not meant for that) but its shape is very suitable to newborn babies. Our son is 3.5 months old now and we are still using it a lot, not sure for how long but by now the pad has already paid off its price :)

This is a great size pad.  Instead of buying covers, I just lay down a bath towel over it, cheaper and easier for me.  Baby just loves lying in this pad, I sometimes let her hang out on the pad on the floor, not just for diaper changes.  Very sturdy, seems to wipe clean easily.  The curved sidewalls are a must, I could never use a flat pad after using this.

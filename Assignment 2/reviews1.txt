I love this booster!  I didn't think I would like it because it just looked like a junky plastic booster to me from the pictures.  But, after reading the rave reviews I ended up getting one.  BEST decision ever.I really like how adjustable it is.  I use all 3 different tray settings because sometimes I want the tray right next to his belly to prevent food from falling all over his lap.  Sometimes I just want him to be contained and I leave him more space to wiggle.  I haven't had to use the height adjustment because his legs aren't long enough worry about just yet.It folds up into a convenient square for traveling and I keep it in my car.  The tray is much more convenient than using the high chairs they have in most restaurants.  And I just throw the tray in the dishwasher when it gets dirty.The only con I see right now is that the straps are getting rather dirty.  I don't see a convenient way to take them off without undoing the buckles completely from the straps.  Other than that-I love everything about this little chair!
